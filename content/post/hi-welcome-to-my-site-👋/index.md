After four days of study and practice, I finally finished building this website.

To be honest, at first I just wanted to simply apply a few *HTML* and *CSS* templates to build a simple page. But a chance led me to discover Hugo.

I just thought Hugo's themes were very nice until I explored it further and found its code was also very easy to use. I decided to use Hugo to build this website right away. The result is as you can see, I think it is very good.

I will post a tutorial on how to use Hugo's template to build a personal website like this.

Good night~!ðŸŒ™
