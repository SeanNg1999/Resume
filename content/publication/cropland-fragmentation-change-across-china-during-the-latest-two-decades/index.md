abstract: There is an urgent need for a thorough assessment of cropland
  fragmentation to provide valuable insights for guiding policies related to
  cropland protection, restoration and other relevant measures. Despite the
  growing number of studies focusing on cropland fragmentation, we currently
  lack a nationally comprehensive, long-term, and fine-scale understanding of
  spatial and temporal changes in cropland fragmentation across China. In this
  study, we aim to address this gap by establishing a new synthetic cropland
  fragmentation index (CFI) and analyzing the change status of cropland
  fragmentation at the county level in China from 2000 to 2021. Additionally, we
  identify the relationships between CFI and key factors from both human and
  natural perspectives using Beta regression analysis. The results show that
  counties with high cropland fragmentation (CFI>0.8) are mainly located in the
  central part of China and in the coastal areas, and the counties with low
  cropland fragmentation (CFI<0.2) are mainly in the North China Plain, the
  Northeast Plain, and some areas in the northwest. For counties experiencing
  increased or decreased fragmentation, the primary types of cropland conversion
  are between cropland and grassland, as well as between cropland and forests.
  The third major type of conversion is cropland being transformed into
  impervious surfaces. CFI had a significantly negative linear relationship with
  total area of cropland in each county while showing a positive relationship
  with the total cropland patches in each county. The variable CFI and slope,
  CFI and NTL had a quadratic parabolic relationship. The results of our study
  would help policymakers to formulate targeted and sustainable land-use
  policies for the sustainable socio-economic development of China.
