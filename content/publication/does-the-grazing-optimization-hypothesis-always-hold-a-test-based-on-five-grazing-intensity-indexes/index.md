abstract: Grazing is one of the controls of aboveground net primary productivity
  (ANPP) in grassland ecosystems. The grazing optimization hypothesis (GOH)
  predicts that appropriate grazing pressure benefits ANPP and that the response
  of ANPP to grazing intensity follows a single-peaked pattern. We conducted a
  meta-analysis to investigate whether the GOH always holds, using qualitative
  grazing levels, stocking rates, and three forage consumption rates (FCR I, FCR
  II, and FCR III) as grazing intensity indexes. Our findings supported the GOH,
  as ANPP responded unimodally to FCR III on the global scale, with the ANPP
  response peaking (12% increase) at the optimal grazing intensity (FCR III =
  58%). Moreover, combining FCR I and FCR II's relationships with ANPP changes,
  it can be inferred that the response of grassland ANPP should exhibit an
  increasing and then declining pattern with growing actual grazing pressure.
  However, the single-peaked pattern, consistent with that predicted by the GOH,
  is supported primarily by data from wet grasslands. Additional evidence is
  needed to test the GOH in arid grasslands, although the effect of stocking
  rates on ANPP response also showed a single-peaked pattern in arid grasslands.
  Our findings highlight the need to consider grazing-induced changes in plant
  growth when quantifying the stress of livestock herbivory on grasslands, and
  we recommend FCR III as an excellent indicator of grazing intensity.
