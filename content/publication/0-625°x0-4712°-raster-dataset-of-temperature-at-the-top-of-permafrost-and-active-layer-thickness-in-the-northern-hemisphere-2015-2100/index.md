abstract: "The 0.625°x0.4712° raster dataset of temperature at the top of
  permafrost and active layer thickness in the Northern Hemisphere (2015-2100)
  was developed using the widely validated and applied Kudryavtsev method, which
  integrates the effects of temperature, snow, vegetation, and soil on
  permafrost, based on the new GCM outputs from the sixth phase of the
  International Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) and the SoilGrids
  2.0 dataset. The data were calculated under four different scenarios, SSP126,
  SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585, from 2015 to 2100. And the permafrost area was
  obtained based on the temperature at the top of permafrost. The dataset
  includes the data covering 2015-2100: (1) mean annual temperature at the top
  of permafrost; (2) annual active layer thickness; (3) annual permafrost area.
  The resolution of spatial data is 0.625°x0.4712°. The dataset is archived in
  .tif and .xls data formats, and consists of 690 data files with data size of
  35.6 MB (Compressed to one single file with 27.9 MB)."
