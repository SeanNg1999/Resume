abstract: "Accurate estimates of spatial patterns of daily precipitation are
  critically important for numerous hydrologic applications. However, the
  estimation of daily precipitation is still challenging, especially in regions
  with sparse observation networks and complex terrain. Although satellite
  precipitation products can offer continuous precipitation fields on a daily
  scale, the data contain large bias and coarse spatial resolution, which limit
  the application of these products in local studies. Here, we developed a new
  spatially varying coefficient downscaling approach to yield a daily
  precipitation field with high\x02resolution and high-accuracy in a high
  mountainous watershed. First, the random effect eigenvector spatial filtering
  (RESF) model was introduced and improved by considering the nonlinear term;
  second, the residuals were corrected by applying the simple inverse distance
  weighted (IDW) method. Using the proposed method, named RESF-IDW, the Global
  Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) was downscaled from 0.1o to 0.01o
  by integrating reanalyzed atmospheric data and environmental variables as
  auxiliary information. The performance of RESF-IDW was evaluated and compared
  with the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method and the original
  GSMaP precipitation products at 20 national and automatic stations by using
  leave\x02one-out cross validation. The results show that significant
  improvements in terms of CC (24.52%, 10.07%, 20.64% and 5.66%), MAE (31.37%,
  15.33%, 29.69%, and 19.43%) and RMSE (24.12%, 15.03%, 21.13%, and 7.14%) are
  achieved using RESF-IDW compared to the original GSMaP products, GWR-IDW, GWR,
  and RESF. The RESF\x02IDW model can be used to correctly improve the original
  GSMaP product under different precipitation intensities, with CSI improvements
  of 38.81%, 43.14% and 44.58% for low, medium and high precipitation
  intensities, respectively. The use of residual correction enhances the spatial
  accuracy (MAE decreases by 19.43% on average) and the precipitation detection
  capability (CSI increases by 12.09% on average) of the RESF estimations. Based
  on the error metrics, the RESF-IDW model can be used to generate improved
  precipitation estimates on a daily scale and has a good capability for
  precipitation detection over different intensities. The proposed method in
  this study provides a promising way to generate accurate daily precipitation
  fields with high spatial resolution over data sparse and high mountain
  regions."
