abstract: Satellite-based and reanalysis precipitation products have received
  increasing popularity in agri-cultural, hydrological and meteorological
  applications, but their accuracy is still uncertain in dif-ferent areas. In
  this study, six frequently used high-resolution daily precipitation products,
  including Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data
  (CHIRPS), Global Satellite Map-ping of Precipitation (GSMaP), Integrated
  Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Meas-urement (IMERG),
  Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), Precipitation
  Esti-mation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural
  Networks-Cloud Classification System-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CCS-CDR)
  and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis V5-Land
  (ERA5-Land), were comprehensively evaluated and com-pared in nine regions over
  mainland China between 2015 and 2019. The results reveal that, in general,
  GSMaP is the best precipitation product in different agricultural regions,
  especially based on the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) and critical
  success index (CSI). ERA5-Land and MSWEP tend to have the highest probability
  of detection (POD) values, and MSWEP tends to have the smallest relative root
  mean squared error (RRMSE) values. GSMaP performs better at almost all
  precipitation levels and in most agricultural regions in each season, while
  MSWEP has the best performance in capturing the time series of mean daily
  precipitation. In addition, all precipitation products perform better in
  summer and worse in winter, and they are more accurate in humid re-gions. The
  findings of this study will contribute to understanding the uncertainties of
  precipitation products, improving product quality and guiding product
  selection.
