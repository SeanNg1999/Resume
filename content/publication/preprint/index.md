abstract: "Exploring the pattern of population flow will help reveal the law of
  urban systems and connections between cities. Based on Baidu migration data
  from March 9 to April 28, 2021, the “hierarchical-network” structure of cities
  in Northeast China was studied from the perspective of population migration by
  using fractal theory, urban scaling law, social network analysis and
  Self-organizing maps method. The results are as follows: (1) The primacy ratio
  of urban system based on migration scale is low, and the distribution of
  high-order cities is concentrated. The scale fractal characteristics of
  migration routes are concentrated in the high-order and loose in the low
  order. The relationship between migration scale and urban population is super
  linear, and Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin are at the first level. (2) In the
  network based on migration scale, Shenyang, Changchun, Siping, Tieling and
  Harbin are at the core of the network, while Harbin, Shenyang, Changchun and
  Dalian are the key hub cities of the network. (3) There are obvious
  differences in the structure of the network between the directed migration
  flow and the net migration flow. The migration scale of Shenyang and Changchun
  is larger, while the net migration volume of Harbin is higher. (4) There is a
  spatial agglomeration phenomenon of migration behaviors, and the core regions
  are in the east, central and southern regions. The migration behaviors within
  the region are mainly intra-provincial migration, which can be divided into
  four sub-groups according to migration preferences. (5) The internal
  connection of the Harbin-Changchun metropolitan area is weak, and the
  Central-and-Southern Liaoning Area has shown a trend of agglomeration
  development. (6) Cities in northeast China can be divided into six types
  according to their migration scale and network location, such as
  high-migration core city and high-migration semi-marginal city, which can
  better reveal the inner characteristics of cities than a single scale
  hierarchy division."
