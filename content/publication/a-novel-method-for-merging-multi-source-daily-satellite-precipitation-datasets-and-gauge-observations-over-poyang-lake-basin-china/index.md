abstract: Obtaining precipitation estimates with high resolution and high
  accuracy is critically important for regional meteorological, hydrological and
  other applications. Although satellite precipitation products can provide
  precipitation fields at various scales, their application is limited by the
  relatively coarse spatial resolution and low accuracy. In this study, we
  propose a multi-source merging approach for generating accurate and
  high-resolution precipitation fields at a daily time scale. Specifically, a
  random effects eigenvector spatial filtering (RESF) method was first applied
  to downscale satellite precipitation datasets. The RESF method, together with
  Kriging, was then applied to merge the downscaled satellite precipitation
  products and station observations. The results were compared against
  observations and a data fusion dataset, Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble
  Precipitation (MSWEP). It was shown that the estimates of the proposed method
  significantly outperformed the individual satellite precipitation product,
  reducing the average value of mean absolute error (MAE) by 52% and root mean
  square error (RMSE) by 63%, respectively. Daily precipitation estimates showed
  similar spatial patterns to MSWEP product, and were more accurate in almost
  all cases, with a 42% reduction in MAE and 46% reduction in RMSE. The proposed
  approach may serve as a promising way to generate accurate daily precipitation
  fields with high spatial resolution.
